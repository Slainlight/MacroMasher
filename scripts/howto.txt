How to input a keystroke.
(A list of every key input is in resources/virtualKeys.txt)

Make sure you make the key name ALL CAPS.
key A
key 0
key VK_SPACE
key VK_F4

A small trick, to make a capital letter put a 1 after your letter
key A 1

-

Most people don't want to peck out full words so you can use the word command

MUST BE ALL CAPS (will be typed lowercase)
Also cannot be more than 1 word

word HIPPOPOTOMONSTROSESQUIPPEDALIOPHOBIA

If you wanted to capitalize the first letter this is how:
key H 1
word IPPOPOTOMONSTROSESQUIPPEDALIOPHOBIA

-

sleep 500 ( this waits for 500 milliseconds, you can change the # of milliseconds)
(1000 milliseconds = 1 second)

-

click left (all must be all lowercase)
click right (all must have exact spelling)
click middle (usually give a mouse position first)

-

mousePos 50 100 (moves your mouse 50 pixels right and 100 pixels down from top left)

-

Sometimes you need to hold a key for longer than a millisecond, in this case
you can use the down and up commands
keyDown A
sleep 100
keyUp A

Also you can use combo keys like this
keyDown VK_MENU (alt)
keyDown VK_TAB
keyUp VK_MENU
keyUp VK_TAB

CAUTION!!
You must make the key come back up! If not you get very strange behavior

-

Debugging!
After your script runs it created a lineAnalysis text file
In this file it tells you what command you used and the number identifier
if this identifier returns -1 then your command is invalid!
This is probably because you typed it incorrectly and so it's the same
number of lines down so you should be able to find it and fix it.

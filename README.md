A small application to take in text files as commands and replicate human input for Windows.

## Usage example

You could write a set of inputs to open an application and configure it accordingly.
You could use the application as a TAS tool.
You could use the tool as a way to give instructions on how to do something. (such as create a new file or locate a directory to go to)
My friend actually used it to send a discord message every 5 minutes on a 'cookie clicker' like bot system.
You could write a quick macro to give you cookies in cookie clicker.
